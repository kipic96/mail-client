# Mail Client

Mail Client Application in C# by Marcin Chilicki

The user can log to it's email account on Gmail, Interia or O2 sites and check his mailbox.

Current features:
- Receiving mails (only 100 mails max currently, because "less is more")
- Viewing simple mail (yeah, that works fine)
- Sending mails (only to one person at a time)
- Partially encripted passwords (SecureString didn't want to work with me)
- Not crashing (this is the best one, I think)
- Maybe more soon, really, maybe
